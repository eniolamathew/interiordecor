# Roomify.org - AI-Powered Interior Design

Roomify.org is a SaaS platform that leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize the interior design industry. Launched in October 2023, Roomify empowers users to create personalized, high-quality interior designs tailored to their preferences within seconds. By simply providing details such as room type, preferred style, and color palette, users can generate realistic visuals of their ideal space through a sophisticated AI model.

## How Roomify Works

Roomify combines cutting-edge AI and web technologies to deliver an intuitive, seamless design experience:
- Users input details about the space they want to design—room dimensions, style preferences, colors, and more.
- Roomify's backend processes this input, fine-tuning the data before passing it to a large language model (LLM) for image generation.
- The platform generates a high-quality, realistic visual representation of the interior space and provides a custom URL where users can view and download their designs.

## Technology Stack

Roomify is built on a robust microservices architecture to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance:
- **Frontend**: Developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), offering a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Implemented in **Go**, with microservices connected via **gRPC** for efficient communication between services.
- **Messaging Queue**: Powered by **Kafka** to handle asynchronous tasks such as image generation requests.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** serves as the primary database, ensuring reliable and efficient data storage.
- **Containerization**: The entire platform is containerized using **Docker**, enabling seamless deployment across environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrated CI/CD ensures continuous deployment, testing, and seamless updates as the platform evolves.

## Deployment

Roomify is deployed on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) for enhanced control over the server environment and scalability.
